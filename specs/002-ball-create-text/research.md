# Research: Ball Create Text Animation

**Feature**: Ball Create Text Animation  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Technology**: p5.js for 2D animation and physics simulation

## Technology Decisions

### Decision: Use p5.js for 2D Animation
**Rationale**: p5.js provides a simplified API for 2D graphics and animation compared to vanilla HTML5 Canvas. It offers built-in functions for drawing shapes, handling user input, and managing animation loops. The library is well-documented, has a large community, and is specifically designed for creative coding projects like this ball animation system.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Vanilla HTML5 Canvas: More complex API, requires manual animation loop management
- Three.js: Overkill for 2D animation, adds unnecessary 3D overhead
- CSS animations: Limited physics simulation capabilities, not suitable for complex ball interactions

### Decision: Implement Custom Ray Casting Algorithm
**Rationale**: The specification requires intelligent ball targeting using ray casting to find optimal bounce angles and spawn positions. p5.js doesn't include built-in ray casting, so we'll implement a custom algorithm using line-line intersection mathematics.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Simple random bouncing: Would not meet the intelligent targeting requirements
- Pre-calculated paths: Too rigid, doesn't adapt to dynamic grid states
- Third-party physics libraries: Adds complexity and dependencies

### Decision: Use Grid-Based Collision Detection
**Rationale**: The animation uses a discrete grid of squares, making grid-based collision detection the most efficient approach. Each ball position can be mapped to a grid cell for fast collision checks.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pixel-perfect collision: Too computationally expensive for real-time animation
- Bounding box collision: Not precise enough for the grid-based system
- Continuous collision detection: Unnecessary complexity for discrete grid system

## Implementation Patterns

### Animation Loop Structure
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(800, 600);
  // Initialize grid, balls, and UI controls
}

function draw() {
  background(255);
  // Update ball positions
  // Check collisions
  // Update grid state
  // Draw everything
}
```

### Ball Physics Implementation
- Use velocity vectors for ball movement
- Implement bounce reflection with angle deviation
- Use p5.js `ellipse()` for ball rendering
- Use `rect()` for grid squares

### Ray Casting Algorithm
- Cast rays at integer angles from -X to +X degrees
- Use line-line intersection to find grid square hits
- Prioritize carveable squares over protected squares
- Use intersection points for spawn positioning

### Grid Management
- 2D array to represent grid state (black/white/protected)
- Map screen coordinates to grid indices
- Handle edge padding (5 squares on each side)
- Track carveable vs protected squares

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies
- Limit ray casting to necessary angles only
- Use efficient collision detection with grid lookups
- Minimize DOM manipulation during animation
- Use p5.js built-in functions for optimal rendering

### Memory Management
- Reuse ball objects instead of creating new ones
- Limit maximum number of balls to prevent memory issues
- Clear completed animations to free resources

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test ray casting algorithms with known grid configurations
- Test ball physics with controlled scenarios
- Test grid state transitions
- Test user input handling

### Integration Testing
- Test complete animation flow from text input to completion
- Test edge cases (isolated squares, all balls destroyed)
- Test user customization controls
- Test performance with various text sizes

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- p5.js (latest version via CDN)
- HTML5 Canvas API (built into browsers)

### Development Dependencies
- Jest for unit testing
- Browser developer tools for debugging

### No External APIs Required
- All functionality is client-side
- No server dependencies
- Works offline after initial load

# Implementation Plan: Ball Create Text

**Branch**: `002-ball-create-text` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-ball-create-text/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create an animated ball carving effect that gradually reveals text by bouncing balls that turn black squares white. The system converts text to a grid, initializes balls around the edges, and uses intelligent ray casting to guide balls toward carveable areas while avoiding protected text patterns. Built using p5.js for smooth 2D animation and physics simulation.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+ with p5.js library  
**Primary Dependencies**: p5.js (latest), HTML5 Canvas API  
**Storage**: N/A (client-side only, no persistence)  
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, manual testing for animation  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Single web application (static site)  
**Performance Goals**: Smooth animation at 60fps, responsive user controls  
**Constraints**: Client-side only, no server dependencies, works offline  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user interactive animation, typical text inputs (1-50 characters)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ Static-only: No backend/server or secrets introduced
- ✅ Performance budget: LCP ≤ 2.5s, CLS ≤ 0.1, initial JS ≤ 200KB gzip (p5.js ~200KB, minimal additional code)
- ✅ Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA checks pass (no critical violations - visual animation with user controls)
- ✅ Simplicity: Added deps/tools materially reduce complexity (p5.js simplifies 2D animation vs vanilla Canvas)

**Post-Design Re-evaluation**: All gates continue to pass. The modular JavaScript architecture with p5.js provides clean separation of concerns while maintaining simplicity. No additional dependencies or complexity introduced beyond the core requirements.

**Structure Decision**: Single web application structure with modular JavaScript files for different system components. Each major feature (text conversion, ball animation, ray casting, grid management) gets its own module for maintainability and testability.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

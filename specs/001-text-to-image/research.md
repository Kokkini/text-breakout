# Research: Text to Image

**Feature**: 001-text-to-image  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Phase**: 0 - Research & Technical Decisions

## Technical Approach Research

### Decision: Vanilla Web Technologies Only
**Rationale**: Constitution requires simplicity and no dependencies. Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript provides all necessary functionality for text-to-image conversion without build tools or external libraries.

**Alternatives considered**:
- React/Vue.js frameworks - Rejected: Adds complexity and violates simplicity principle
- Canvas API for image manipulation - Rejected: Overkill for simple character composition
- WebAssembly for performance - Rejected: Unnecessary complexity for this use case

### Decision: Client-Side Image Composition
**Rationale**: Static-only requirement means all processing must happen in the browser. HTML/CSS can compose character images horizontally with proper spacing.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-side image generation - Rejected: Violates static-only principle
- Canvas-based composition - Rejected: More complex than needed
- SVG-based composition - Rejected: PNG images are already provided

### Decision: Input Validation Approach
**Rationale**: Real-time validation provides better UX than post-submission validation. JavaScript can validate input as user types and disable convert button when invalid.

**Alternatives considered**:
- HTML5 input validation only - Rejected: Limited control over validation messages
- Post-submission validation - Rejected: Poor user experience
- Third-party validation library - Rejected: Violates no-dependencies principle

### Decision: Character Image Loading Strategy
**Rationale**: Preload all character images on page load to ensure fast conversion. Use simple img elements with proper alt text for accessibility.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Lazy loading character images - Rejected: Would cause delays during conversion
- Dynamic loading during conversion - Rejected: Poor user experience with loading delays
- Sprite sheet approach - Rejected: Character images already exist as individual files

### Decision: Space Handling Implementation
**Rationale**: CSS margin or padding between character images provides clean spacing. No special space character image needed.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Space character image - Rejected: No space.png exists in chars folder
- CSS letter-spacing - Rejected: Doesn't work well with image composition
- Fixed-width character containers - Rejected: Unnecessary complexity

### Decision: Error Handling Strategy
**Rationale**: Graceful degradation - skip missing characters rather than showing errors. This maintains user experience even if some character images fail to load.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Show error messages for missing characters - Rejected: Poor UX for partial failures
- Placeholder images for missing characters - Rejected: No placeholder images available
- Block conversion on any missing character - Rejected: Too restrictive

## Performance Considerations

### Image Optimization
- Character images are already provided as PNG files
- No additional optimization needed for 36 small character images
- Total image payload should be well under performance budget

### JavaScript Performance
- Vanilla JavaScript will be minimal (< 10KB)
- No external dependencies to load
- Simple DOM manipulation for image composition

### Accessibility Implementation
- Semantic HTML structure with proper form elements
- Alt text for all character images
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management for convert button state

## Security Considerations

### Static File Serving
- No server-side processing required
- No user input sent to external services
- All character images are static assets
- No secrets or credentials involved

### Input Sanitization
- Client-side validation prevents invalid characters
- No server-side processing means no injection risks
- Static nature eliminates most security concerns

## Deployment Strategy

### Static Hosting Compatibility
- Compatible with any static hosting provider
- No server configuration required
- No build process needed
- Direct file serving sufficient

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- No polyfills needed for core functionality
- Graceful degradation for older browsers (basic functionality only)

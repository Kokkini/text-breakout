# Tasks: Text to Image

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-text-to-image/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Not requested. Skipping test tasks per specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Static site**: `public/` (assets), `src/` (scripts/styles), `docs/` (guides)
- Paths assume a single static site per plan.md

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create `public/` with `index.html`
- [x] T002 Create `public/styles/main.css`
- [x] T003 Create `public/scripts/app.js`
- [ ] T004 Create `docs/quickstart.md` placeholder (to be filled from spec quickstart)
- [x] T005 [P] Copy `chars/` images into `public/assets/chars/` or reference existing path

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core static build and quality gates required before user story work

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T006 [P] Add basic layout and form elements to `public/index.html` (input, convert button, clear button, output area)
- [ ] T007 [P] Implement Lighthouse/axe check scripts (manual run instructions in `docs/quickstart.md`)
- [x] T008 Configure accessibility attributes and keyboard navigation in `index.html`
- [ ] T009 Document constitution gates in README section within `docs/quickstart.md`

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Basic Text to Image Conversion (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Convert user-typed alphanumeric text into a horizontally-arranged composite image using character PNGs

**Independent Test**: Type alphanumeric text, click convert, verify composite image appears in output area within 3 seconds

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Implement input handling and button wiring in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Implement `processText(text)` per contract in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Implement character-to-image mapping using `public/assets/chars/` in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [x] T013 [US1] Implement `composeImage(characters)` to render horizontally with gaps (Canvas or DOM) in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [x] T014 [US1] Implement `displayCompositeImage(canvas)` to show result in `index.html`
- [x] T015 [US1] Style output area in `public/styles/main.css` for clear visibility

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 functional and independently verifiable

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Character Image Management (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Ensure robust loading and management of character images

**Independent Test**: Each alphanumeric character maps to its image; missing images are skipped without errors

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T016 [P] [US2] Preload all character images on page init in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [x] T017 [US2] Implement graceful handling for missing images (skip) in `composeImage`
- [x] T018 [US2] Add alt text and ARIA labels for accessibility in `index.html`
- [ ] T019 [US2] Ensure performance within budgets (optimize DOM/canvas usage)

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 functional and independently verifiable

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - User Interface and Experience (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide intuitive and responsive UI for input and viewing generated image

**Independent Test**: Users can input text, convert, and view results; UI responsive on mobile/desktop

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T020 [P] [US3] Refine layout and responsive styles in `public/styles/main.css`
- [x] T021 [US3] Implement real-time validation with `validateInput(text)` and button enable/disable logic in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [ ] T022 [US3] Implement Clear button behavior in `public/scripts/app.js`
- [ ] T023 [US3] Add user guidance and ARIA live region for status messages in `index.html`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 functional and independently verifiable

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T024 [P] Update `docs/quickstart.md` with final screenshots and steps
- [ ] T025 Code cleanup and comments for maintainability
- [ ] T026 Performance tuning (minimize layout thrash, reduce reflows)
- [ ] T027 Accessibility final pass (axe/Lighthouse)

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - no dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - may reuse US1 logic
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - improves UI/UX of US1/US2

### Within Each User Story

- Models/processing functions before composition
- Composition before display
- Core implementation before UX refinements
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- [P] tasks in different files (`index.html`, `main.css`, `app.js`) can run concurrently
- Image preloading (US2) and CSS refinements (US3) can proceed in parallel after US1 is stable

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. STOP and VALIDATE: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery
1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

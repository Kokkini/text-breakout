# Feature Specification: Text to Image

**Feature Branch**: `001-text-to-image`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "text to image: I want static web app that let the user type in a message, the user clicks a button and it turns into an by combining the letters and numbers in the chars folder. Each png in the chars folder is an image of 1 letter (a-z) or number (0-9)"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: How should characters be arranged in the composite image? → A: Characters arranged horizontally in a single row (like normal text)
- Q: How should missing character images be handled? → A: Skip missing characters entirely (remove from output)
- Q: What input validation should be applied for special characters? → A: Only alphanumeric characters and space
- Q: How should spaces be handled in the character image composition? → A: Show spaces as gaps between character images
- Q: How should empty input be handled? → A: Disable the convert button when input is empty

#### Amendments (2025-10-09)

- Q: Should the output be a single image or multiple elements? → A: A single composed image (canvas) with white background
- Q: Should there be spacing between adjacent characters? → A: Yes, a small fixed gap between characters; larger gaps for spaces
- Q: Should there be left/right margins in the image? → A: Yes, add a leading and trailing space to create left/right white margins

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Text to Image Conversion (Priority: P1)

A user wants to convert their typed text into a visual image composed of individual character images.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that delivers the primary value proposition of the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by typing any alphanumeric text, clicking the convert button, and verifying that an image is generated showing the text composed of individual character images.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has opened the web app, **When** they type "hello" and click convert, **Then** they see a single image showing "hello" composed of individual letter images
2. **Given** a user has typed "test123", **When** they click convert, **Then** they see a single image showing "test123" with both letters and numbers composed of individual character images
3. **Given** a user has typed text, **When** they click convert, **Then** the generated image is displayed prominently on the page

### User Story 2 - Character Image Management (Priority: P2)

The system needs to handle the character images from the chars folder and map them to user input.

**Why this priority**: This enables the core functionality by providing the visual components needed for text conversion.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that each character (a-z, 0-9) has a corresponding image that loads correctly and displays when that character is used in text conversion.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app has loaded, **When** a user types a character that exists in the chars folder, **Then** the corresponding character image is used in the output
2. **Given** a user types a character not in the chars folder, **When** they convert the text, **Then** the missing character is skipped entirely (removed from output)

---

### User Story 3 - User Interface and Experience (Priority: P3)

Users need an intuitive interface to input text and view the generated image.

**Why this priority**: This provides the user interaction layer that makes the core functionality accessible and usable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that users can easily input text, trigger conversion, and view results through a clear, responsive interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they see the interface, **Then** they can clearly identify where to type text and how to convert it
2. **Given** a user has generated an image, **When** they want to try different text, **Then** they can easily clear the input and generate a new image
3. **Given** a user is on a mobile device, **When** they use the app, **Then** the interface remains usable and responsive

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user types special characters or symbols (input validation prevents this)
- How does system handle very long text input?
- What happens when user types only spaces or empty text? (Convert button is disabled)
- How does system handle rapid successive conversions?
- What happens if character images fail to load?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a text input field for users to enter alphanumeric text and spaces only
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a convert button that triggers text-to-image generation
- **FR-003**: System MUST load and display character images from the chars folder (a-z, 0-9)
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate a single composite image (canvas) showing the input text using individual character images arranged horizontally with small gaps between adjacent characters and larger gaps for spaces, on a white background
- **FR-005**: System MUST display the generated image prominently on the page
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle missing character images by skipping them entirely (removing from output)
- **FR-007**: System MUST support text input containing both letters and numbers
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a way for users to clear input and generate new images
- **FR-009**: System MUST be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices
- **FR-010**: System MUST load character images efficiently without blocking the user interface
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate input to accept only alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9) and spaces
- **FR-012**: System MUST render spaces as gaps between character images in the composite output
- **FR-013**: System MUST disable the convert button when input field is empty or contains only whitespace
 - **FR-014**: System MUST render the composite on a white background as a single image artifact
 - **FR-015**: System MUST include left and right white margins by adding a leading and trailing space in the composition

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Text Input**: User-entered alphanumeric string that will be converted to image
- **Character Image**: Individual PNG file representing a single character (a-z, 0-9)
- **Composite Image**: Generated visual output combining individual character images to form the input text

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can convert any alphanumeric text to image in under 3 seconds
- **SC-002**: 95% of character images load successfully on first page load
- **SC-003**: Users can successfully convert text containing both letters and numbers 100% of the time
- **SC-004**: Generated images display clearly and are readable on both desktop and mobile devices
- **SC-005**: Users can complete the full text-to-image workflow (type, convert, view) in under 30 seconds
- **SC-006**: System handles text inputs up to 50 characters without performance degradation
